 * You are battling a powerful dark wizard. He casts his spells from a 
 * distance, giving you only a few seconds to react and conjure your 
 * counterspells. For a counterspell to be effective, you must first identify 
 * what kind of spell you are dealing with. The wizard uses scrolls to conjure 
 * his spells, and sometimes he uses some of his generic spells that restore his 
 * stamina. In that case, you will be able to extract the name of the scroll 
 * from the spell. Then you need to find out how similar this new spell is to 
 * the spell formulas written in your spell journal. Spend some time reviewing 
 * the locked code in your editor, and complete the body of the counterspell
 * function. Check Dynamic cast to get an idea of how to solve this challenge.
